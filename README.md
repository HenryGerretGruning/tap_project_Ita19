## Needed installations

To use this project you should install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to your computer. Should use
Apache and MySQL.

## Description

This project consists of files that make up tha baseline for web page. It is built using MVC model. This project can
connect to database - I used phpmyadmin.

As said this project has Model that consists of data for this project, Controller that worries about conecting urls and
connecting to database, and also View displays data using the Model class object.

In public folder there are all the visuals and app consists on basic MVC files.

## Getting started

To get started you need to download this project and I recomment to open it in PhpStorm. Also you should have local
database to use this project and local server host.

When you have those three things you shoulb be good to go. To connect to database you should configure the constants as
you have them - in config directory.
